## Summary

Build an analytics service to track events on websites.


## Explanation

There are plenty of good analytic services, but that doesn't mean you can't build a better one. Your analytics service will offer a few key features:

*A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows a user to track events on their website.
*A server-side API that captures and saves those events to a database.
*A Rails application that displays the captured event data for a user.
